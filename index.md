# My First Webaite

## Thoughts: 
- I have never used markdown before
- This is a very simple and easy way to format 
- I will definitely have to get used to writing with this format

```
I wonder what this does and what it looks like?

int count = 0
for (int i = 0, i =< 0, i++){
  if (i+1 = 6){
      count++
  }
}
```
*I wanna write in Italics*
**This is in bold**
